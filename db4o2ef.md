# Introduction #

The Db4objects.Db4o.EntityFramework assembly is an adapter for .NET 4.0 Entity Framework (net4ef).


## Whats Included? ##

  * `Db4oEntityContext`: Wraps up the db4o IObjectContainer and presents your application with a set of interfaces more similar to the DataContext generated by net4ef.
    * I had attempted to create Db4oEntityContext as a dynamic class that would emit its own strongly-typed access properties, but apparently .NET dynamic types don't support extension methods, so you can't use LINQ on a dynamic type. I left the code there for now. To use it, just use `dynamic db = new Db4oEntityContext(fileName);` instead of `var db = new Db4oEntityContext(fileName);`.
  * `Db4oEntitySet`: Simple, strongly-typed and queryable entity "table" adapter.


## What isn't included? ##

No data annotation support of any kind. Support for System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations will come in a separate bundle so it can be used on its own without the net4ef adapter.

# Getting Started #

  1. Download and compile the Db4objects.Db4o.EntityFramework assembly.
  1. Inherit from Db4oEntityContext to hook up your strongly-typed access members. See [ModelTestEntities.cs](http://code.google.com/p/db4o-extras/source/browse/trunk/net/Db4objects.Db4o.EntityFramework.Test/Model/ModelTestEntities.cs) for an example.
```
using System;
using System.Linq;
using Db4objects.Db4o.EntityFramework;

public class MyEntityContext : Db4oEntityContext{
  public MyEntityContext() : base("MyApplication.db4o") {}

  public Db4oEntitySet<Car> Cars{
    get{ return GetEntitySet<Car>("Cars"); }
  }  

  public Db4oEntitySet<Person> People{
    get{ return GetEntitySet<Person>("People"); }
  }
}
```
  1. Use it in your classes!
```
// Using db4o like this in your app is bad practice.
// Open the db when your app starts up, and reuse the Context 
// (or !IObjectContainer) as long as your application is running.
// Web Applications please see the db4o-extras/net/Db4objects.Db4o.Web project.
using(var db = new MyEntityContext()){
  db.People.AddObject(new Person("Bob Burns"));
  db.People.AddObject(new Person("Anne Anders"));
  db.SaveChanges();
}
```
