To get started, download the [https://db4o-extras.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/java Java branch] from source control. There are two directories. In the 'server' directory contains a db4o Java server. The 'extra' directory contains the other extras.

    * bin/ The install / start / stop scripts
    * conf/ The configuration of the server
    * datamodel/ Drop you jars with the datamodel in this directory. It will be used by the server
    * lib/ The db4o & supporting jars
    * log/ The directory which the logs are written to



== Gettring Started With The Extras ==
The extras are build using [http://maven.apache.org/ Apache Maven]. You can call mvn package to build the project.

Or you can open the project you're favorite IDE, using a maven plugin.
