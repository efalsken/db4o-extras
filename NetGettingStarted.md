# Getting Started #

To get started, download the [net branch](https://db4o-extras.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/net) from source control, open the included solution and compile. If you have [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.net/) and either [AnkhSVN](http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/) or [VisualSVN](http://www.visualsvn.com/visualsvn/) installed, you can open the solution directly from within Visual Studio. Use the `File > Open > Subversion Project` menu item.

Once you have the project open, the projects are set up to compile using the dependencies in the `net/lib` folder. You should not have to download or install anything else. Note that if you wish to use a different version of db4o than included here, just replace the Db4objects.Db4o.dll file in the `lib/db4o/net-4.0` folder.
